          FAQ:
        </h1>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <h3>Who can compete?</h3>
            <p>Everyone is welcome to compete. All you need to do is register for the event.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>Is there a competitor limit?</h3>
            <p>If we list a competitor limit in the home page of the competition website, there is a competitor limit. 
              Otherwise, there is no competitor limit. You just need to make sure to register before the registration deadline.
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>How do I register?</h3>
            <p>Click on the registration tab on the competition website. These are usually hosted through <a href="https://www.cubingusa.com/" class="faqLink">CubingUSA</a>.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>Where can I find my WCA ID?</h3>
            <p>f you have never competed before, you do not have a WCA ID will automatically be assigned one when the results for your first competition are posted.
              If you have competed before, you can find your WCA ID and profile by searching for yourself on the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons?" class="faqLink">WCA website.</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>Do spectators have to pay to attend?</h3>
            <p>Spectators may drop in at any time and watch for as long as they want for free. However, everyone is encouraged to compete.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>This is my first competition. What do I need to know?</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure the competitor is familiar with the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/" class="faqLink">WCA regulations</a> and has watched the <a href="https://www.cubingusa.com/ctutorial.php" class="faqLink">CubingUSA Competitor Tutorial</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>I can only attend for part of the competition. Can I do my solves early?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, no. In order to keep the competition running smoothly, we have to stay on schedule.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>Are competitions organized by age?</h3>
            <p>No.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>When do I need to show up?</h3>
            <p>Look at the schedule on the competition website. You must show up for registration (we usually plan to have it end right before the first round of 3x3). You must also be present and ready to compete during all events that you are registered for. The schedule is subject to change. We recommend coming about 15-30 minutes before the start of your first event.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>What events will be at this competition?</h3>

          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>Can you add more events?</h3>
            <p>No. We plan our schedule to fit as many events as possible. If you don't see an event listed on the competition website, there's a good chance we'll have it at a future competition.</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>What are the cutoffs/time limits?</h3>
            <p>All cutoffs are listed on the schedule. If there isn't one specified, it is the WCA default cutoff (usually 10 minutes).</p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>What do the cutoffs mean?</h3>
            <p>

                  <td>The first solve must be under the cutoff time in order to finish the mean.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>

          </li>

            <h3>Where can I see the results for the competition?</h3>
            <p>During the competition, live results will be posted on <a href="http://www.cubecomps.com/" class="faqLink">CubeComps</a>. These results are unofficial. A week or so after the competition, official results will be posted on the <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/" class="faqLink">WCA website</a>.</p>

            <h3>Can I join the Michigan Cubing Club? Can I buy a shirt?</h3>
            <p>Anyone is welcome to attend our events (competitions). However, only University of Michigan students may officially join and buy club apparel. If you wish to join and are in high school or above, <a href="contactus.html" class="faqLink">contact us</a>.</p>
          
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <h3>What's the point of competing if I can't win?</h3>
            <p>People go to competitions to meet people, make friends, talk about cubing, improve their own official personal best times, and have fun. People of all ages, backgrounds, and skill levels attend competitions. Very few people actually go to competitions to win them.</p>
