                    Cubing Club was founded in January 2012 at the University of 
                    Michigan with the goal of spreading the art of cubing 
                    among the <br>cube-deprived. Now, we're almost there - all we need is YOU.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    We offer free workshops led by our unpaid, fully-trained
                    officers. Skill levels ranging from "I've-never-touched-a-Rubik's-Cube"
                    to "I-was-born-with-a-cube-in-my-hand"
                    are more than welcome. 
                    After helping you determine your skill level, we will aid you on your cubing journey. 
                    Homemade solution guides are also available to members who are interested in
                    improving their solve time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Periodically, we hold friendly speed-cubing competitions.
                    And, for all of the puzzle-lovers out there, we also have many 
                    "cubes" that aren't so cubical - periodically, we will teach and present
                    a variety of 3D puzzles. So, let's get this party started!
